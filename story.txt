Intrigued, she walked up to the door and knocked. When no one answered, she cautiously opened the door and stepped inside. The cottage was dark and musty. It was clear that it hadn't been used in many years. Lily explored each room, until she came to a small door at the back of the house. She opened it and climbed a narrow staircase. At the top of the staircase was a small attic room. Lily walked over to the window and looked outside. What she saw took her breath away. The view from the window was of the most beautiful garden she had ever seen. The flowers were in full bloom and the sun was shining. Lily felt like she had been transported to another world. She climbed back down the staircase and went outside to explore the garden. She soon realized that she had never seen this garden before, even though she had been exploring the woods for years. It was as if the garden had appeared out of nowhere. Lily spent the rest of the day exploring the garden and picking flowers. She was so happy that she had found this hidden gem. She knew that she would never forget the magical day she spent in the secret garden.
